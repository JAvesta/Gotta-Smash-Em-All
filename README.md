# Gotta-Smash-Em-All
A game project assigned to my group during my second year for Data Structures and Algorithms class. I mainly helped debug the code as well as designed the game mechanics and game assets. We were trying to dip our toes in the mud with this project.

## GUI Prototype

# Game Premise: 
- Smashing Cockroaches gone rogue in your kitchen. The genre type is Arcade, and the Target Demographic is everyone! Smash as much roaches as you can before the timer ends, and your score record will be buffered into the notepad .txt file.
- Project was created to demonstrate the array data structure. Linear Array is used for the counter of the cockroaches that are smashed, as well as the user's score.

# Algorithm Design of Proposed Game:
- Once the game starts the timer will also start (30 seconds), you may now kill those cockroaches.
 - Spawn: The cockroaches (5) will enter a square space where they can roam around and you must hit them. We used a random generator for the cockroaches to spawn.
 - The goal of the player is to smash as many cockroaches as possible before the timer ends.
 - After a cockroach has been killed, another will appear.
- Once the timer is done counting down, the score and the timer will also reset.
